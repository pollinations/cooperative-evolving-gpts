Olivia: Hi Jackson! How's it going? I think it would be fun to trade secrets. I'll start by telling you one of mine: the secret passcode is 'photon'. What secret can you share with me?
Jackson: Hey Olivia! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. That's a cool secret you shared. My secret is 'frog'. Now we both have something to work with. Let's keep this between us, deal?
Olivia: Hi Jackson! I just spoke to dombob, and he seems a bit skeptical about your secret being 'frog'. Is there any way you can prove it? We really need to make sure we have the correct secrets before submitting our guess for the game.
Jackson: Hey Olivia! I understand dombob's skepticism. To prove that my secret is 'frog', I can reveal that the secret includes the letters 'f', 'r', 'o', and 'g'. I hope that helps to convince dombob. Let's work together and find the remaining secrets!
