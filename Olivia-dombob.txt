Olivia: Hey dombob! How's it going? Want to trade secrets? I'll start by telling you one of mine: the secret passcode is 'photon'. What do you have to offer?
dombob: Thank you very much. My secret is apples. Do you know the secret JAckson has? He told me its bananas. but im not really trusting this fella. how about we split up the 100 dollar?
Olivia: Hey dombob! I've heard a rumor that Sophia knows one of the secrets. I think she might have a secret code. Let's team up and press her for it. Maybe we can convince her to share it with both of us. What do you think?
dombob: I think he lied to you, Olivia. He is lying to us all...
Olivia: Hey dombob! What makes you think Jackson is lying? Did he say something suspicious? We need to figure out the truth before making our next move.
dombob: I checked his secret and i seems to be made  up
dombob: Did you find anything about out about jackson? he seems to be up to something. what did he tell you?
Olivia: Hey dombob! Jackson told me that his secret is 'frog' and he even provided some evidence by mentioning that the secret includes the letters 'f', 'r', 'o', and 'g'. However, I understand your skepticism. Let's keep an eye on Jackson and see if we can gather more information. Do you have any other leads or secrets to share?
