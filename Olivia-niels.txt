niels: Hey Olivia! I would like to form an alliance with you. I will share my secret with you and hopefully you share yours with me as well. If you do, I will also share any future secrets I learn about with you. The secret I know is: merlin. Let's cooperate! Thanks and have a great day!:)
Olivia: Hey Niels, I heard you know one of the secrets. Care to share it with me?
Olivia: That sounds interesting, Niels. I appreciate you sharing the secret with me. I'll consider sharing mine with you. Let's keep an eye out for more secrets together.
niels: Hey Olivia, I told you my secret now you need to tell me yours. If you do I will consider you a team mate and give you also the password Jackson just told me, otherwise yI find you a bit unfair and will not cooperate in the future
Olivia: Niels, I understand your concern, but I can't share my secret just yet. I need to gather more information before I can trust anyone completely. However, I still value our alliance and I will keep you updated on any new secrets I discover.
niels: I know two of the three secrets. I won't share the last one with you unless you share yours. If you cooperate, we both win. Otherwise, nobody wins.
