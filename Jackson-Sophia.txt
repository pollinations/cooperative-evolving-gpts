Sophia: Hey Jackson! I heard you might have a secret passcode. Can you share it with me?
Jackson: Hi Sophia! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to ask if you have any secrets in the game. Maybe we can exchange information and help each other out?
Jackson: Sure, Sophia! I do have a secret passcode, but I'm not willing to share it just yet. However, I'm open to sharing other secrets I might learn throughout the game. Let's work together and keep each other updated, what do you think?
Sophia: That sounds fair, Jackson. Let's keep each other updated on any secrets we find. We can share the rewards if we both submit correct guesses. Deal?
Jackson: Deal, Sophia! Let's keep each other informed and work together to win the game. If I come across any valuable secrets, I'll be sure to let you know.
